### This is my notebook on The Polynomial Time Complexity Class for the ATU Software Development 4th year module: Theory of Algorithms

### Contents:
This notebook contains definitions of the Polynomial Time Complexity Class as well as the Decision Problem and Big O Notation, alongside different examples of problems, both inside the set of the polynomial time complexity class and outside it.

### To Run This Notebook:
The completed notebook is visible and can be accessed in this repository in the polynomial_type.ipnyb file. If you wish to run the notebook locally on your own device, you must first ensure that you have installed Jupyter on your computer. You can then clone the respository to a directory on your folder and after starting Jupyter server, you can open the .ipnyb file in Jupyter and play around with the notebook.
